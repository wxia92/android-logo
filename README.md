Android Logo by William Xia

Description:
This android logo was created and animated with pure css. 

What I learned:
I learned that you can create a lot from just pure css. Many shapes and designs can be created through creative manipulation of properties such as border radius. Also, I learned how to use css to create simple animations when an element is hovered over by the user's mouse.
